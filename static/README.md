Stores all the static content for your future website: images, CSS, JavaScript,
etc. When Hugo builds your site, all assets inside your static directory are
copied over as-is. A good example of using the static folder is for verifying
site ownership on Google Search Console, where you want Hugo to copy over a
complete HTML file without modifying its content.
