All content for your website will live inside this directory. Each top-level
folder in Hugo is considered a content section. For example, if your site has
three main sections—blog, articles, and tutorials—you will have three
directories at content/blog, content/articles, and content/tutorials. Hugo uses
sections to assign default content types.
